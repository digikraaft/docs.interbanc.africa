### Setup your account

Before you can start using Interbanc, you need to  create an account [here](https://app.interbanc.africa). Alternately, you can send a message to [support@interbanc.africa](mailto:support@interbanc.africa) requesting an account to be created for you.

### Create an App
Once you have access to the [dashboard](https://dash.interbanc.africa), you need to create an app. Creating an app will generate an API key that enables you to start using Interbanc's API. You are now ready to start using Interbanc's powerful APIs.
