## Welcome

This documentation provides you with all the information you need to use the Interbanc API. It also provides a playground to test API responses.

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens. You can get this from (your dashboard)[https://app.interbanc.africa/settings/apis]. You should treat your API token as a passoword and should not be included in your version control.
