Interbanc Pay offers seamless payment integrations for your apps.

## How it works

When building payment into your app, below is a general way of interacting with Interbanc Pay API:

1. On your checkout page or from your server, initiate a payment by calling the initiate (Payment Intent Endpoint)[/api-reference/endpoints/payment-intent/create]. The Payment Intent Endpoint will return a (response) [/api-reference/endpoints/payment-intent/get] containing a Payment Link with which you can redirect your customers to for them to complete the payment.

2. Verify the payment. You must confirm the payment was successful by using the (Verify Payment Endpoint)[/api-reference/endpoints/payment-intent/verify].

3. Confirm the payment details before giving value to your customer. The (Payment Verification Endpoint)[/api-reference/endpoints/payment-intent/verify] will return full details about the payment. Confirm key details (status, amount, currency) from the endpoint before giving value to your customer.

That's it!


## Payment Pages

Payment pages allow you to receive fixed amount payments from multiple customers. Here is how to use payment pages:

1. Create a payment page. You can either create a payment page from (your Dashboard)[https://app.interbanc.africa] or use the (Create Payment Page Endpoint)[/api-reference/endpoints/payment-page/create].

2. Share your Page Link. If you're using the (Create Payment Page Endpoint)[/api-reference/endpoints/payment-page/create], redirect your customer to the page link that will be returned from the endpoint. Alternately, if you're using the (Dashboard)[https://app.interbanc.africa], copy the link and include this on your website or share directly with your customers. The customer then completes the payment.

3. Verify the payment. If you're using the (Create Payment Page Endpoint)[/api-reference/endpoints/payment-page/create], you can (verify the payment)[/api-reference/endpoints/payment-intent/verify] using the Payment Reference that was returned via the call back URL or by listening to (Payment Page Webhook Events)[/api-reference/endpoints/webhooks/payment-page]

4. Confirm the payment details before giving value to your customer. The (Payment Verification Endpoint)[/api-reference/endpoints/payment-intent/verify] will return full details about the payment. Confirm key details (status, amount, currency) from the endpoint before giving value to your customer.


### When can you use Payment Pages?
Payment pages can generally be used when you need to collect fixed payment amounts from your customers or anyone at that. Below is a list of possible scenarios you can use Payment Pages for:

1. No code payment collection. Payment pages can easily be used to collect payments without the need to code or for a website. Just share the Payment Page Link and start receiving payments.

2. Course Tutors. Payment Pages can be used for Course Tutors to sell their courses. The payment page link can easily be shared with potential students to make payment.

3. Online Vendors. Instead of giving out account details all the time, Online Vendors can easily share their payment page links to customers for payment.
